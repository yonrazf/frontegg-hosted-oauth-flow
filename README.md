2. Get your application ID from [ENVIRONMENT] → Applications
3. Get your Frontegg domain from the Frontegg Portal → [ENVIRONMENT] → Keys & domains
4. This sample runs on `http://localhost:3000`. If your application uses a different port, make sure to add `http://localhost:3000` under → [ENVIRONMENT] → Authentication → Login method → Redirect URLs.
